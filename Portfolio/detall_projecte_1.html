                <h2>DETAILED RESEARCH REPORT: HYGIENE EFFICACY STUDY</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>This research project focused on analyzing the presence and proliferation of microorganisms, primarily bacteria, found on commonly used surfaces within a secondary school environment.</p>

                    <p>The core objective was to quantify bacterial colonies on surfaces frequently handled by students and teachers to raise awareness about hygiene risks and evaluate the efficacy of current cleaning practices.</p>

                    <h3>1. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN & METHODOLOGY</h3>
                    <p>The practical component involved conducting seven distinct culturing tests using Agar-Agar plates. Each test compared microbial samples taken from a "dirty" side of a surface versus a "clean" side (cleaned immediately before sampling).</p>

                    <p>Surfaces sampled included: mobile phones, hands, laboratory tables, door handles, photocopiers, computer keyboards, and the school bathroom.</p>

                    <h3>2. KEY FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The results confirmed a significant presence of microbial life, with the uncleaned samples from the men's bathroom showing the highest number of colonies by far.</p>

                    <p>Crucially, the comparison demonstrated that a thorough cleaning using soap and detergent was highly effective, often resulting in zero bacterial colonies on the "clean" side of the Petri dish.</p>

                    <p>The analysis highlighted mobile phones and hands as the most critical points of hygiene, given their direct pathway to the body via the oral route.</p>

                    <h3>3. CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
                    <p>The hypothesis—questioning the sufficiency of habitual hygiene measures—was partially validated; while cleaning is effective, the high initial contamination suggests inconsistent or insufficient daily practice.</p>

                    <p>The final recommendation urges individuals to take proactive responsibility for maintaining the cleanliness of their immediate work areas and personal items to prevent microbial imbalances and potential health risks.</p>
